                            ACHTUNG!
               ALLES CODEMONKEYS UND DEVELOPERS!

Das codemachine ist nicht fuer gefingerpoken und mittengrappen.
You might end up schnappen the crashtest, blowenfusen und debuggen
with the headashbang.

Es ist nicht fuer gevurken by das dumkopfen. Das rubbernecken
sightseeren, und das peering at this file without knowledge macht
bigge troubles und loss of sleepen. Das beste practice ist:
keepen das fingers out of das unkaesslich code unless you know
what you are doing.

Relaxen und trusten das previouser coders, und if du must change,
make sure you commitzen and testzen. If du breaken, fixen it schnell!
